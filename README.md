# c_sharp_snakes

This is my first attempt with C#  
My tech test challenge was to write the first stages of the Snakes and Ladders kata, in a familiar language and then convert to C#.

My initial rendition was completed (following TDD principles) in Ruby - see [Snakes_Ladders_Ruby](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/snakes_ladders_ruby)

This repo contains my (fairly direct) C# translation. I haven't used a TDD approach as that was done initially in Ruby. It is still my intention to recreate the unit tests in NUnit but given the time constraints I have chosen to focus on learning the language.  
My initial impression of C# is that its a great language and so easy to create a functioning console application. The benefits of statically typed languages is clear and I will definitely take the time now to learn TypeScript.
