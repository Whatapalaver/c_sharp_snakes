C# Snakes and Ladders Kata - Feature 1 Only
====

The challenge is to code the first feature from [Agile's Snakes and Ladders Kata](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/SnakesAndLadders-Kata). It was also requested that we write the first stages of the Snakes and Ladders kata, in a familiar language and then convert to C#. My initial rendition was completed (following TDD principles) in Ruby - see [Snakes_Ladders_Ruby](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/snakes_ladders_ruby)

## _Feature 1 - Moving Your Token_

---

```
As a player
I want to be able to move my token
So that I can get closer to the goal
```

```
As a player
I want to move my token based on the roll of a die
So that there is an element of choice in the game
```

```
As a player
I want to be able to win the game
So that I can gloat to everyone around
```

## _Discussion_  

This is my first attempt with C#  

This repo contains my (fairly direct) C# translation. I haven't used a TDD approach as that was done initially in Ruby. It is still my intention to recreate the unit tests in NUnit but given the time constraints I have chosen to focus on learning the language and fathoming out how to set up my system to allow C# coding. I initially attempted to use VSCode but switched to Visual Studio Community asthis seemed to offer a neater environment in which to learn. 

My initial impression of C# is that its a great language and so easy to create a functioning console application. The benefits of statically typed languages is clear and I will definitely take the time now to learn TypeScript.
